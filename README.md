# Competitive-Programming-Problem-Solutions-CPP
A library of all(most) of the problem I have done that is still findable on my current laptop, mostly ranging from 2023-present.

---

This is a copy of the code directory on my computer, which stores the code for the majority of competitive programming problems I have done.

This directory will normally update on a montly basis.

How the naming system works:
1. All names are translated to English no matter if the original name is in what language.
2. All files starting with U are from USACO, the two letters following being the division and the round that problem belongs to.
3. All files starting with P are from [luogu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/list).
4. All files starting with CF and gym are from [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).
5. All files starting with AT are from [atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/).
6. All files starting with CSES are from [CSES](https://cses.fi/).
